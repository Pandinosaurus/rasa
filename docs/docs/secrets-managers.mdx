## Secrets Managers
Secrets managers are used to safeguard credentials used to authenticate to external services,
like databases.

Rasa Pro supports the following secrets managers:
* [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault)


Currently, Rasa Pro supports sefeguarding credentials for the following services:
- [Tracker Stores](./tracker-stores.mdx)


## Vault Secrets Manager

The Vault Secrets Manager is used to store credentials used to authenticate to external services.
The credentials are stored in a Vault instance and can be encrypted at rest.

If you need to encrypt your credentials,
you can use the [Vault Transit Engine](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/transit).

:::note
Expiring tokens need to be renewed periodically, and renewal process is done over the network,
we will try to renew the token 5 seconds before it expires.
If token's TTL is less than 5 seconds, we will try to renew it ASAP,
but it might fail due to network latency.
:::


### Authentication
Rasa Pro supports authentication to Vault through
[Token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/token).

Both `expiring` and `non-expiring`(so called, root tokens) tokens are supported.
Rasa Pro will automatically renew the token if it is expiring.


### How to configure access to Vault

Access to Vault secrets manager can be configured with environment variables
and through `endpoints.yml` configuration file.

Environment variables and `endpoints.yml` configuration file are merged together
and *the values from the environment variables take precedence*.

Following environment variables are available:
```bash
SECRET_MANAGER = "vault" # which secrets manager to use, currently only vault is supported
VAULT_HOST # address of the vault server
VAULT_TOKEN # token to authenticate to the vault server
VAULT_RASA_SECRETS_PATH # path to the secrets in the vault server, if not set it defaults to `rasa-secrets`
VAULT_TRANSIT_MOUNT_POINT # if transit secrets engine is enabled, set this to  mount point of the transit engine
```

The `endpoints.yml` configuration for vault secrets manager looks like this:
```yaml-rasa {3} title="endpoints.yml
secrets_manager:
    type: vault
    token: <token used to authenticate to Vault>
    url: "http://localhost:1234"
    secrets_path: rasa-secrets  # if not set it defaults to `rasa-secrets`
    transit_mount_point: transit # if you have enabled transit secrets engine, and you want to use it
```

#### How to combine environment variables and `endpoints.yml`
A simple example on how to combine environment variables and `endpoints.yml` configuration file
would be to store access token in the environment variable and the rest of the configuration
in the `endpoints.yml` file.

```bash
# environment variables
VAULT_TOKEN=<token used to authenticate to Vault>
```


```yaml-rasa {3} title="endpoints.yml
secrets_manager:
    type: vault
    url: "http://localhost:1234"
    secrets_path: rasa-secrets  # if not set it defaults to `rasa-secrets`
    transit_mount_point: transit # if you have enabled transit secrets engine, and you want to use it
```

### Example
This is a simple example which demonstrates how to store credentials for tracker store in Vault
and how to access them from Rasa.

1. Start Vault instance
    ```bash
    docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK --name=vault -p 1234:1234 -p 8200:8200 -e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=myroot' -e 'VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:1234' -d vault
    ```

2. Store credentials for tracker store in Vault
    ```bash
    # go inside Vault container
    docker exec -it vault sh

    # (optional) if you get access denied error
    export VAULT_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:1234
    export VAULT_TOKEN=myroot

    # store secret in the Vault under the group rasa-secrets
    vault kv put -mount=secret rasa-secrets sql_store_username=postgres sql_store_password=12345
    ```

3. Start Postgres container
    ```bash
    docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=rasa -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=12345 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
    ```

4. Configure Rasa to access the Vault instance

    Checkout the [How to configure access to Vault](#how-to-configure-access-to-vault) section for more details.

5. Configure Rasa to use the Vault secrets manager to fetch credentials for the tracker store
    ```yaml-rasa {3} title="endpoints.yml
        tracker_store:
              type: SQL
              url: localhost:5432
              username:
                    source: secrets_manager.vault
                    secret_key: sql_store_username
              password:
                    source: secrets_manager.vault
                    secret_key: sql_store_password
    ```

6. Start Rasa
